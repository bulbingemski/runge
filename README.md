There is a differential equation with initial conditions. We have to solve it using Runge-Kutta 4th order method with a 3/8 rule.

As a result code give's us some graphical stuff where blue is the basic function and the black curve means the approximated function y.

As the final sweetness in console you would see the value of y for x = 2.

y(2) =  2.5855377866955225

As you see, in this work we don't care about calculating errors.
